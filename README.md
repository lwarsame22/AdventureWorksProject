# AdventureWorksProject

A Small Project to Showcase SQL & Power BI Skills.

The database used for the project was the Adventure Works Sample Data from Microsoft.

This database can be found here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms

Using a SQL script provided by TechTalkCorner, the AdventureWorksDW database was updated with recent dates and new dates inserted in the date dimension. 

This Updated SQL Script can be found here : https://github.com/techtalkcorner/SampleDemoFiles/blob/master/Database/AdventureWorks/Update_AdventureWorksDW_Data.sql

Once the databased had been updated , I sought to develop a business request that was created by Ali Ahmad.



Methodology.



Once connecting the AdventureWorksDB to SQL Server Management Studios and ensuring all the database had been installed correctly.
I ran the updated script and began to cleanse the data required to complete the business request. The  SQL scripts provided beginning with DIM, 
showcased how I cleansed the data and extracted the required columns from the table. 


Once the scripts had been prepared I ran and saved the resulting .csv files to upload to Power BI.
Using said .csv I created a dashboard in Power BI that fulfilled the targets set in the business request.
